# House-Prediction-Model
This project predicts house prices using machine learning models based on features like carpet area, location, and ownership. It includes data preprocessing, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features. Models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost are trained, evaluated, and compared for accurate price prediction.
